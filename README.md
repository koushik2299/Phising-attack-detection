## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-detection.git
   cd phishing-detection

## Data Collection
The dataset used for training and testing the Machine Learning model can be found in the data directory. It comprises a balanced set of legitimate and phishing website examples.

## Model Training
The model_training.ipynb Jupyter Notebook contains the code for model selection, training, and evaluation. We explore various ML algorithms and fine-tune the chosen model for optimal performance.

## Real-time Detection
The app.py file contains the code for the real-time detection web application. It integrates the trained ML model to analyze website URLs entered by users and provides instant phishing detection results.

## Evaluation and Metrics
In the evaluation.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, we assess the performance of the ML model using standard evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the detection system, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
